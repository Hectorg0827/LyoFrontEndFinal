# Fixing "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code"

This document summarizes the steps taken to fix the "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed" error in the React Native iOS build.

## Changes Made

1. **Created Improved Bundle Script**
   - Enhanced `simple-bundle.sh` with better error handling and fallbacks
   - Added detailed logging for easier debugging
   - Implemented multiple methods to find and use the React Native CLI
   - Added support for different environments (Node.js paths, etc.)

2. **Updated Xcode Project Configuration**
   - Changed the build phase script from `ultimate-bundle.sh` to `simple-bundle.sh`
   - Ensured proper file permissions (executable)

3. **Created Helper Scripts**
   - `bundle-script-status.sh` - Checks if bundle script setup is correct
   - `pre-build-check.sh` - Performs pre-build validation and creates necessary directories
   - `fix-bundle-reference-final.sh` - Updates Xcode project to use the simple bundle script

## Key Fixes in simple-bundle.sh

1. **Better Environment Handling:**
   - Added checking and fallbacks for Node.js path
   - Properly validates environment variables
   - Creates output directories if they don't exist

2. **Multiple CLI Methods:**
   - Can use local react-native CLI
   - Can use npx with react-native
   - Can fall back to direct script execution
   
3. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Detailed error messages with line numbers
   - Verification of outputs
   - Fallbacks for missing directories

4. **Timestamp File Creation:**
   - Creates timestamp files for proper build phase completion
   - Has fallbacks if directories don't exist

## Common Causes of "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed" Errors

1. Missing environment variables (CONFIGURATION, CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR, etc.)
2. Node.js not found or not in PATH during build
3. Missing output directories
4. Permission issues with scripts
5. React Native CLI not found or not working
6. Missing timestamp file for build phase tracking

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Run `./bundle-script-status.sh` to check the current setup
2. Run `./pre-build-check.sh` before building
3. Look at the Xcode build logs for specific error messages
4. Ensure Metro bundler is running if needed
5. Make sure all dependencies are installed (`npm install` or `yarn install`)
